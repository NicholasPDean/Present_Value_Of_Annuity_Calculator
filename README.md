1.) Purpose 
   --------------------------------

I made this calculator becuse I wanted to spread knowledge on the time value of money. The app teaches consumers that a series of periodic payments in the future is worth less in today's dollars when calculated as a lump sum due to inflation. This helps consumers make more educated decisions regarding loan payments or court settlements. I hope that this app can help remind others to always consider the future of their economic wellbeing and help them make educated financial decisions as a result. 

2.) What I Learned 
   -------------------

One of the biggest lessons I learned during this project is how important it is to have a clearly-defined mission when creating a product. Without having a clear idea of a product's purpose, development efforts can slow and examining market white space becomes difficult as well.

From a technical standpoint, I learned a lot as well. I taught myself Swift (iOS programming language) and XCode (iOS IDE) to be able to create the app. Additionally, I learned about display constraints as I wanted to ensure that my app worked on a variety of screen sizes.
